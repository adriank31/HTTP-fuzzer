# What is an HTTP-Fuzzer

An HTTP-Fuzzer is a cybersecurity tool used for testing the robustness of web applications by sending a variety of crafted HTTP requests to identify vulnerabilities. This tool simulates malicious user behavior, such as SQL injection, to discover flaws in input validation, authentication, and other application layers. By automating the process of injecting payloads and testing responses, it enhances the security assessment process, helping security professionals pinpoint weaknesses and improve the resilience of web applications against attacks.


# Key Features

- Matrix-style aesthetic with dynamic green console output.
- Multi-threaded design for efficient and fast scanning of multiple URLs.
- Support for custom SQL injection payloads from an external file.
- Support for custom HTTP headers to tailor requests.
- Detects multiple SQL injection types, including time-based, Boolean-based, and error-based.
- Seamless integration with pipeline input for scanning large URL lists.
- Real-time detection logs with detailed information on vulnerabilities.
